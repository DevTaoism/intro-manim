**ManimCE** has three versions, each version uses a different graphics engine: **PyCairo**, **OpenGL** and **WebGL**. The **OpenGL** and **WebGL** versions do not yet have stable versions, so in this course the version used by **PyCairo** will be studied.

How ManimCE works?
*************************

ManimCE + PyCairo works as follows:

1. **Python** reads your script.
2. **Manim's** library converts its language to **PyCairo** language, and renders every frame.
3. After all the images are generated, **Manim** calls **FFmpeg** to concatenate them into a video.

You can see the complete process in this image.

Basic structure
*************************

The basic structure of any Manim script is very simple:

.. code-block:: python

    # Import manim library
    from manim import *
    
    class SceneName(Scene):
        """
        By convention, the structure of your animation
        is defined in the construct method, but later 
        we will learn how to do it in different ways.
        """
        def construct(self):
            # Create a text using Text class
            text = Text("Hello world")

            # Text animation
            self.play(Write(text))

            # Pause
            self.wait()

1. First you import the library: ``from manim import *``
2. Create a class with the name you want to give to your **.mp4** file, this class must inherit from the ``Scene`` class.
3. Create a ``construct`` method.
4. Define your animation structure within the construct method.
5. Save your script with some name, with the extension **.py**, let's say, ``my_script.py``
6. To render your code you must activate your **virtual environment** and use this command (or some variation):

.. code-block:: sh

    manim my_script.py SceneName -pql

* ``manim``: It is the command that calls the ManimCE library.
* ``my_script.py``: It is the name of your script.
* ``SceneName``: It is the name of your class that inherits from the ``Scene`` class.
* ``-pql``: They are the flags that indicate the resolution of the video.

    * ``p``: **Preview** - Indicates that when the video is finished rendering, it will automatically open with your default video software. I recommend using `mpv <https://mpv.io/>`_.
    * ``q``: **Quality** - Indicates that the next command will define one of the resolutions that come by default in Manim.
    * ``l``: **Low resolution** - It indicates that the video will be rendered at 854x480 at 15 fps (**REMARK** this command must go after the ``q`` flag, otherwise it won't work). You can replace this flag with these other three:

        * ``m``: **Medium resolution**: 1280x720 at 30FPS.
        * ``h``: **High resolution**: 1920x1080 at 60FPS.
        * ``k``: **4K resolution**: 3840x2160 at 60FPS.

As you can guess, you can define several classes that inherit from the ``Scene`` class in your **.py** file, and when rendering it you simply have to indicate their name on the command line after typing the name of the **.py** file.

Result:


.. raw:: html

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <video allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" controls>
        <source src="../_static/basic_videos/SceneName.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    </div>


.. warning::
    Keep in mind that if you render a video that you have already rendered before, this new one will overwrite the previous one, one way to avoid this is by using as an additional flag:
    ``-o FILE_NAME``
    Where ``FILE_NAME`` is the name you want your **.mp4** file to have.


Mobjects
*************************

The objects that can be displayed on the screen are called Mobjects, and there are several types, but the most important are the following three:


* ``Mobject``: This is the abstract class that generates all the following Mobjects.
* ``ImageMobject``: They are raster images, that is, bitmaps, such as PNGs, JPGs, etc. At the moment Manim does not have support for GIFs.
* ``VMobject``: They are vector figures, in general, **BÃ©zier curves**, these are the most flexible **Mobjects**, since you can define your own VMobjects yourself or use the ones that come by default.
* ``Group`` and ``VGroup``: They are groups of **Mobjects** and **VMobjects** respectively, by grouping several **Mobjects/VMobjects** it allows us to modify these groups in a simpler and faster way.

The Mobjects that we are going to use the most in the basic sections will be subclasses of **VMobjects**, these are: lines ``Line``, circles ``Circle``, squares ``Square``, texts ``Text``, etc.

It is important to note that the **texts** are not *"pure"* VMobjects, the texts are **imported SVG** that Manim generates using the fonts of your system, the same happens with the texts generated in **LaTeX**.

We will study the texts in detail in **Section 7**, the important thing for now is to understand that the texts are SVG that Manim reads and converts them into VMobjects.


Jupyter Notebook
*************************

In order to use Manim with Jupyter Notebook you must install ``jupyter`` in your virtual environment, using:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip3 install jupyter

To use it simply run in your terminal:

.. code-block:: sh

    jupyter-notebook

Create a new file, select **Python 3 (ipykernel)**:

.. image:: ../_static/images/create_jn.png
   :align: center
   :width: 60%

And use it in the following way:

.. image:: ../_static/images/jn_example.png

If you use VSCode you can also use it together with Jupyter-Notebook, you just have to indicate your virtual environment to VSCode.

If you are a beginner it is a good idea to use this tool so that your learning is more comfortable.


Add Mobjects to screen
*************************

There are two ways to add an object to the screen, either with an animation (as we will see below), or by using the ``Scene.add()`` method.

This method adds a Mobject instantly, without animation or duration.

If a scene has no duration (that is, it has no animations or pauses) then Manim will render this scene as an image.

Try rendering the following scene with the ``-pql`` flags.

.. code-block:: python

    class SceneWithoutDuration(Scene):
        def construct(self):
            sq = Square()
            self.add(sq)
            # self.wait()

If you try, you won't get an **.mp4** file, as this scene has no duration. If you uncomment the last line then you will get an **.mp4** as a result, since the animation will last 1 second.

To get the last frame of a scene (that is, not render it as .mp4, but as PNG image) then use the ``-ps`` flags instad ``-pql``.


Animations
*************************

.. raw:: html

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <video allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" controls>
        <source src="../_static/basic_videos/anim_types.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    </div>
    <br/>

Types of animations
=========================

There are **two ways** to make animations, one is with **updaters** and the other is using the ``Scene.play`` method. The updaters are more advanced and we will see them later.

``Scene.play``
=========================

The ``Scene.play`` method accepts **two types** of arguments, either **methods of Mobjects as animations** and **class animations**, we will see the methods of Mobjects later after seeing Mobjects properties, the most basic animations are the class animations.

In summary, the ways to make animations are:

* Updaters:

    * Simple updaters
    * :math:`\alpha` updaters
    * :math:`\tt dt` updaters

* ``Scene.play``:

    * Methods of Mobjects
    * Class animations

In this section we will analyze the last one, which is the simplest.

Class animations
----------------------

.. raw:: html

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <video allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" controls>
        <source src="../_static/basic_videos/class_animations.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    </div>
    <br/>

Types
^^^^^^^^^

There are already several predefined class animations, and they are divided into 4 groups.

1. :underbold:`Creation animations`: They add an object to the screen.

2. :underbold:`Indication animations`: They help to identify an object on the screen, they are actually a fusion of the other 3 animations.

3. :underbold:`Transformation animations`: They modify the shape or position of an object.

4. :underbold:`Animations to remove`: They remove an object from the screen.

Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every class animation has the following main properties:

* ``run_time`` *(float)*: It is the duration of the animation.

* ``rate_func`` *(function)*: It is the behavior of the animation, most of them are ``smooth``, but they can also be:

.. code-block:: python

    def linear(t: typing.Union[np.ndarray, float]) -> typing.Union[np.ndarray, float]:
        return t

    def smooth(t: float, inflection: float = 10.0) -> np.ndarray:
        error = sigmoid(-inflection / 2)
        return np.clip(
            (sigmoid(inflection * (t - 0.5)) - error) / (1 - 2 * error),
            0,
            1,
        )

    def rush_into(t: float, inflection: float = 10.0) -> np.ndarray:
        return 2 * smooth(t / 2.0, inflection)

    def rush_from(t: float, inflection: float = 10.0) -> np.ndarray:
        return 2 * smooth(t / 2.0 + 0.5, inflection) - 1

    def slow_into(t: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        return np.sqrt(1 - (1 - t) * (1 - t))

    def double_smooth(t: float) -> np.ndarray:
        if t < 0.5:
            return 0.5 * smooth(2 * t)
        else:
            return 0.5 * (1 + smooth(2 * t - 1))

    def there_and_back(t: float, inflection: float = 10.0) -> np.ndarray:
        new_t = 2 * t if t < 0.5 else 2 * (1 - t)
        return smooth(new_t, inflection)

    def there_and_back_with_pause(t: float, pause_ratio: float = 1.0 / 3) -> np.ndarray:
        a = 1.0 / pause_ratio
        if t < 0.5 - pause_ratio / 2:
            return smooth(a * t)
        elif t < 0.5 + pause_ratio / 2:
            return 1
        else:
            return smooth(a - a * t)

    def running_start(t: float, pull_factor: float = -0.5) -> typing.Iterable:
        return bezier([0, 0, pull_factor, pull_factor, 1, 1, 1])(t)

    def not_quite_there(
        func: typing.Callable[[float, typing.Optional[float]], np.ndarray] = smooth,
        proportion: float = 0.7,
    ) -> typing.Callable[[float], np.ndarray]:
        def result(t):
            return proportion * func(t)
        return result

    def wiggle(t: float, wiggles: float = 2) -> np.ndarray:
        return there_and_back(t) * np.sin(wiggles * np.pi * t)

    def squish_rate_func(
        func: typing.Callable[[float], typing.Any],
        a: float = 0.4,
        b: float = 0.6,
    ) -> typing.Callable[[float], typing.Any]:  # what is func return type?
        def result(t):
            if a == b:
                return a
            if t < a:
                return func(0)
            elif t > b:
                return func(1)
            else:
                return func((t - a) / (b - a))
        return result

    # See all in manim/utils/rate_functions.py

* ``remover`` *(bool)*: It is ``True`` when the intention of the animation is to remove the Mobject from the screen, some class animations that have this attr as ``True`` are ``FadeOut`` and ``Uncreate``.

* ``Mobject`` *(Mobject)*: Some animations only accept VMobjects (like ``Write``) or some specific Mobject for that animation, while others accept any Mobject (like ``FadeIn``).

There are some rules for using ``Scene.play``, one of the most important is that you cannot animate a Mobject twice in the same ``Scene.play`` method.

In the example below, you couldn't have more than one uncommented animation.

.. code-block:: python

    class BasicAnimations(Scene):
        def construct(self):
            text = Text("Hello word")
            self.play(
                Write(text),
                # FadeIn(text),
                # GrowFromCenter(text),
                # FadeInFromLarge(text, scale_factor=2), # <- Some animations require more arguments to work.
            )
            self.wait() # <- It is advisable to always have a wait at the end

And in general, it is always advisable to have a ``Scene.wait`` at the end so that the above animation does not have strange behaviors.

Multiple animations at the same using Scene.play
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    class MultipleAnimationSameTime(Scene):
        def construct(self):
            square = Square()
            circle = Circle()
            self.play(
                Create(square),
                FadeIn(circle)
            )
            self.wait()

Where to see all the predefined animations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some time ago I made `this small documentation <https://elteoremadebeethoven.github.io/manim_3feb_docs.github.io/html/tree/animation.html#animations>`_ of all ManimCairo animations, the use of animations is not the same in ManimCE but you can get an idea of how they work.

The source code of all class animations are in ``manim/animations``.
